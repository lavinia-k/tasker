# tasker

## Background

Having had ReactJS on my list of things to learn for a while now, I figured the Tasker front-end challenge was the perfect reason (read: induced motivation) to learn this popular not-framework JS library.

Codecademy must be credited for their ReactJS I and II courses, from which I gained my initial learning/exposure to ReactJS over the span of 2-3 days.

From there, a combination of StackOverflow questions, Medium.com articles, github repo README files, NPM packages and good old W3C.org served as my main resources.

## Scope

The scope of this challenge was a little vague for me.

I initially started thinking about:

* How would I package this for production deployment?
* What testing framework should I use?
* Should I write a lightweight API to support the one (or two, or three, or four at max) endpoint/s the JSON data would be retrieved by?
* Is Backbone.js the JS framework I should use for the models?

I eventually managed to pull myself back and decided *not* to focus on the above items in light of the amount of time it would take me to get up to speed with Backbone.js and all the other considerations (I was told that completing the challenge is typically meant to take about 5 hours).

I limited my scope to focusing on the plain ReactJS code and components, along with the CSS styling necessary to appease the perfectionist in me (note: I restrained myself from finding the exact font and colours in the images I was meant to replicate).


## Considerations

### File Structure

As I understand it, file structure is really up to the team to define and be comfortable with, so I went with a simple structure of separating stateful and stateless components, adopting some of Airbnb's ReactJS guidelines.


## Feedback

If you would like to pass along any feedback (which I would more than appreciate and be glad to have, even), feel free to shoot me an email at lavinia.k@youtharabia.com or send through a message on LinkedIn.

Thanks for the time you've spent (or are about to spend) looking at this - your honesty is much appreciated.
